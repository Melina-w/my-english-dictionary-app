:bulb: **Reason this repo was created.**

I started my-english-dictionary-app with the desire to keep on learning and practising new technologies. After spending a huge amount of time coding during bootcamp, I created a routine that involves coding everyday. Once Enspiral Dev Academy programme came to an end, I wanted to do something significant with all I have learnt, so I had this idea of creating a dictionary.

:question: **Why a dictionary?**

I used to be an English Language Teacher before becoming a software developer. When I was a student at Uni, I had to carry a really heavy dictionary, also known by all my classmates and I as "Mr Longman". As there was no place for storage at Uni, I had to walk 30 mins everyday from home to the building with my dictionary. Now that I have the opportunity to create an app to make a difference, I want to build a ditionary that could help others  the journey of learning a foreign language. 

:four_leaf_clover: **What does this dictionary app offer?**

As a user you will be able to: :bust_in_silhouette:

- look for any word in English,
- check the words' meanings depending on their word family (noun, verb, preposition, etc), pronunciations, and word family,
- listen to the pronunciation of words,
- see an image of the word you look for,
- log in to your private account,
- once you are logged in, you'll be able to save words as favourites & delete from favourites

:book: **This is an open source project**

I love the idea of open source projects. This is a nice way to support each other collaboratively and make our projects better.
